          What is an access token and refresh token?
        </h2>
        <p>
          An access token is a credential used to access protected resources on
          behalf of a user or application. It is typically used in
          authentication and authorization mechanisms. A refresh token is a
          token used to obtain a new access token after the previous one
          expires.
        </p>
        <p>
          Access tokens are usually short-lived and should be sent with each
          request to authenticate the user. Refresh tokens have a longer
          lifespan and are used to acquire new access tokens without requiring
          the user to re-authenticate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Access tokens and refresh tokens work together in a token-based
          authentication system. When an access token expires, the client can
          use the refresh token to request a new access token from the server
          without requiring the user to log in again.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to securely store these tokens on the client-side.
          They can be stored in browser storage mechanisms such as local storage
          or session storage. Alternatively, cookies with appropriate security
          measures can also be used to store tokens.

          Compare SQL and NoSQL databases
        </h2>
        <p>
          SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two types
          of database systems with different approaches to storing and
          retrieving data:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            SQL databases are based on a relational model and use structured
            schemas. They use tables to store data and enforce strict data
            consistency and integrity.
          </li>
          <li>
            NoSQL databases are schema-less and use various data models like
            key-value, document, columnar, or graph. They provide flexible
            schemas and are horizontally scalable.
          </li>
          <li>
            SQL databases are suitable for complex queries and transactions,
            ensuring strong data integrity. They are often used in applications
            that require ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
            properties.
          </li>
          <li>
            NoSQL databases are designed for scalability, agility, and handling
            large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. They offer
            high performance, horizontal scalability, and flexible data models.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on factors like the
          nature of the data, scalability requirements, transactional needs, and
          the specific use case of the application.

          What is Express.js? What is Nest.js?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Express.js is a popular minimalist web application framework for
          Node.js. It provides a simple and flexible way to build web
          applications and APIs. Express.js offers features like routing,
          middleware support, and template engine integration. It is widely used
          in building backend services and RESTful APIs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nest.js, on the other hand, is a progressive Node.js framework for
          building efficient, scalable, and maintainable server-side
          applications. It combines elements of object-oriented programming,
          functional programming, and functional reactive programming. Nest.js
          is built on top of Express.js and provides additional features like
          dependency injection, modular architecture, and support for
          TypeScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both Express.js and Nest.js are powerful frameworks for building
          server-side applications in JavaScript or TypeScript. The choice
          between them depends on the specific requirements of the project, the
          development team's familiarity, and the desired architectural
          approach.

          What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work?
        </h2>
        <p>
          In MongoDB, the aggregate function is used to perform data aggregation
          operations on the documents in a collection. It allows you to process
          and transform data using a pipeline of stages.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aggregation pipeline consists of multiple stages, each performing
          a specific operation on the input documents. Some common stages
          include filtering documents, projecting fields, grouping and
          aggregating data, and performing calculations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pipeline stages are executed sequentially, and the output of each
          stage becomes the input for the next stage. This allows you to perform
          complex data transformations and computations in a flexible and
          efficient manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aggregation in MongoDB offers powerful features like grouping,
          sorting, filtering, joining data from multiple collections, and
          performing mathematical operations. It provides a flexible and
          expressive way to analyze and process data within the database.
